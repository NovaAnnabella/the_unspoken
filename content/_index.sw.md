# Karibu kwa "The Unspoken"

**Decide for yourself what is true for you and which topics you prefer to look away from.**

I dare to explore the forbidden areas of development and uncover the extraordinary in the world of development.
Expand your horizon and push your limits.
Always remember, technology should make our lives and work easier.

**Only the bravest among us truly manage to make development easier for others.**

When was the last time you completed a project that was practically maintenance-free, robust, and didn't require you anymore? Never? Then you're doing something wrong!
