# AI in the real world - thinking beyond the hype

[![ai_ml](/images/content/ai_ml.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_artificial_intelligence)

### Introduction

When it comes to the use of artificial intelligence (AI), there is a lot of nervous excitement as well as expectations.
Some believe AI will revolutionize the world of work and make human skills obsolete. But before we plunge headlong into
the world of AI, we should consider some important points. AI has undoubtedly made strides made, but it is not new and
comes with significant limitations that we need to understand as well as respect. Spoiler: AI is just another tool. We
are still a long way from movie-like scenes such as in Terminator. Current AI like ChatGPT are also a good example how
software should be designed! Service oriented and not like a Swiss Army Knife aka a solution for everything only rarely
helpful or reusable. A few provocative questions: * Shouldn't any computer scientist who thinks AI is something new or
can take over his or her work  better think about his horizons and expertise? * Salaried Data Scientists who are moving
to AI models.  transitioning: Why is your specific AI model worse than the big everything k√∂nner Language models? What
have you  done before and what are you missing to create equally good models, specific to your usecase?

### Understanding the boundaries

AI models, including those based on GPT, are trained on existing data and patterns. They are good at recognizing
patterns and generating content based on that training, but they lack true understanding or the ability to think beyond
their training. Recognizing this limitation helps, setting realistic expectations. What was never there won't exist.
Qualitative, confidential and secure Information is the minority. There will always be more juniors than seniors. Thus,
AI will only ever work for lowlevel "Hello World" examples. In many areas, such as programmers, who are afraid for their
jobs, they should seriously think about the quality of their work.

### Costs of AI development and the importance of computing power.

The development of AI has been largely driven by the steady advancement of hardware. AI models such as GPT-3.5 require
enormous computing power to handle complex tasks. The cost of AI is closely linked to the required hardware, such as
powerful GPUs and TPUs. In addition, there are ongoing costs for operating and maintenance of the infrastructure.
Increasing computing power has increased the availability of AI, but requires continues to require significant
investment. Cost optimization and efficient resource management are critical to ensure the economic success of AI
projects. Sound cost analysis and planning are therefore essential in the implementation of AI.

### Complement human intelligence

AI should be viewed as a tool that complements human intelligence rather than replacing it. Human judgment, critical
thinking, and creativity remain essential. AI can provide valuable insights, automate repetitive automate tasks and
increase productivity, but it should not be used alone to make key decisions. decisions alone. Without your trust, AI
won't be able to incorporate all your needed aspects. In computer science, AI won't think on its own about issues like:
Resilience, Security, Compliance, Data Privacy, Readablity, Performance, Simplicity, Patterns, Timeliness etc. Example
AI 3D Modeling: [Alex tests AI with Blender](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x60zHw_z4NM&t=460s) (Looks good, but only a
"Hello but is only a "Hello World" example) My experience with AI code generation in one word: ridiculous! Developers
who write such code, I would I would not want to keep. Still, I use AI as a sparring partner aka explain effect, like a
kind of self-reflection. The most effective use of AI is often achieved through collaboration between humans and AI
systems. AI can assist in generating ideas, finding solutions or automating certain tasks, but human oversight and
intervention are critical to refine, improve, and optimize results.

### Validation and test

AI-generated results should always be thoroughly validated and tested. Whether it is code, content, or other outputs,
human supervision is necessary to ensure quality, correctness and compliance of generated results. Verification
processes are critical to avoid relying on inaccurate or misleading Results. Please do not validate AI using another AI.
That would be like me correcting class tests not correcting them myself but using my students.

### Continuous learning and adaptation

AI models must be continuously updated and refined to adapt to changing circumstances. Feedback loops and iterative
improvements are required to ensure the accuracy, relevance, and usefulness of the results generated by AI generated
results. The learning process of AI will never stop.

### Focus on solving real problems

AI should be used to address real problems and create value for people. It is important not to use AI just for its own
sake. Clear objectives, identification of problems and understanding the impact on stakeholders are critical when it
comes to AI solutions.

### Fazit

Artificial intelligence is undoubtedly a powerful tool, but it is important to understand its limitations and to use it
responsibly. AI cannot supplement human intelligence Human judgment, creativity and critical thinking remain
indispensable. Through careful validation, deliberation and collaboration between humans and AI, we can achieve the best
results achieve. Let's use the strengths of AI to solve real-world problems and make the world a better place.
