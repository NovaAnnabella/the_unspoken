# AI in the Real World - Going Beyond the Hype

[![ai_ml](/images/content/ai_ml.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_artificial_intelligence)

## Introduction

When it comes to the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI), there is a lot of hype and high expectations. Some
believe that AI will revolutionize the workforce and render human capabilities obsolete. However, before diving
headfirst into the world of AI, it is crucial to consider some key points. Undoubtedly, AI has made significant
advancements, but it is not a new concept and comes with significant limitations that we need to understand and respect.
Spoiler alert: AI is just another tool. We are far from the movie-like scenarios portrayed in movies like Terminator.
Current AI, such as ChatGPT, also serves as an excellent example of how software should be designed - service-oriented
and not as a Swiss Army knife that rarely proves helpful or reusable.

A few thought-provoking questions:

* Should every computer scientist who believes that AI is something entirely new or can take over their work rethink
  their horizons and expertise?
* To data scientists transitioning to AI models: Why is your specific AI model inferior to the all-rounder large
  language models? What did you do previously, and what is missing to create equally good models specifically tailored
  to your use case?

### Understanding the Limitations

AI models, including those based on GPT, are trained on existing data and patterns. They excel at recognizing patterns
and generating content based on this training, but they lack true understanding or the ability to think beyond their
training. Recognizing this limitation helps set realistic expectations. What doesn't exist cannot be created.
Qualitative, confidential, and secure information is the minority. There will always be more juniors than seniors. As a
result, AI only works well for low-level "Hello World" examples. In many areas, such as programmers who fear for their
jobs, it is crucial to seriously consider the quality of their work.

### The Costs of AI Development and the Importance of Computing Power

The development of AI has been significantly driven by the continuous advancement of hardware. AI models like GPT-3.5
require immense computing power to handle complex tasks. The costs of AI are closely tied to the required hardware, such
as powerful GPUs and TPUs. Additionally, there are ongoing costs for operating and maintaining the infrastructure. While
the increasing computing power has improved the availability of AI, it still necessitates substantial investments. Cost
optimization and efficient resource management are crucial for ensuring the economic success of AI projects. A
well-informed cost analysis and planning are therefore essential in implementing AI.

### Enhancing Human Intelligence

AI should be seen as a tool that enhances human intelligence rather than replacing it. Human judgment, critical
thinking, and creativity remain essential. AI can provide valuable insights, automate repetitive tasks, and increase
productivity, but it should not be solely relied upon for important decisions. Without your input, AI will not be able
to incorporate all the aspects you require in the field of computer science, such as resilience, security, compliance,
data privacy, readability, performance, simplicity, patterns, and staying up to date.

For example, AI 3D modeling: [Alex tests AI mit Blender](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x60zHw_z4NM&t=460s) (Looks
impressive, but it's just a "Hello World" example).

My experience with AI code generation in one word: laughable! I would not want to keep developers who write such code.
However, I use AI as a sparring partner, also known as the Explain-Effect, for self-reflection. The most effective use
of AI is often achieved through collaboration between humans and AI systems. AI can assist with generating ideas,
finding solutions, or automating specific tasks, but human supervision and intervention are crucial to refine, improve,
and optimize the results.

### Validation and Testing

AI-generated outputs should always be thoroughly validated and tested. Whether it's code, content, or any other outputs,
human oversight is necessary to ensure the quality, correctness, and compliance of the generated results. Verification
processes are crucial to avoid relying on inaccurate or misleading outputs. Please do not validate AI using another AI.
It would be like having my students correct their own exams instead of doing it myself.

### Continuous Learning and Adaptation

AI models need to be continuously updated and refined to adapt to changing circumstances. Feedback loops and iterative
improvements are required to ensure the accuracy, relevance, and usefulness of the AI-generated results. The learning
process of AI never stops.

### Focus on Solving Real Problems

AI should be used to address real-world problems and create value for people. It is important not to deploy AI just for
the sake of it. Clear objectives, problem identification, and understanding the impact on stakeholders are crucial when
it comes to AI solutions.

### Conclusion

Artificial Intelligence is undoubtedly a powerful tool, but it is important to understand its limitations and use it
responsibly. AI cannot replace human intelligence. Human judgment, creativity, and critical thinking remain
indispensable. By carefully validating, considering ethical aspects, and fostering collaboration between humans and AI,
we can achieve the best results. Let's leverage the strengths of AI to solve real problems and improve the world.
