# Holacracy - The Dystopia Behind the Utopia

![aws_costs_twitter_1](/images/content/holacracy.png)

### Introduction

Holacracy is celebrated as the holy grail of modern organizational structures. It promises flat hierarchies, more
employee participation, and quick adaptability. But is it really the panacea for organizational problems, or is there
more to it? In this blog post, we take a critical look at holacracy and why it might not be the ideal solution for every
company.

### The Costs of Team Structures

In Holacracy, teams are set up to act as small businesses within the company. Sounds promising at first, but the devil
is in the detail. A team has to cover a multitude of roles, which exponentially increases the team size and thus the
personnel costs. It becomes difficult to bundle the forces and focus on common goals. In addition, coordinating between
many different roles presents a huge challenge. The end results are inefficient teams and high personnel costs, which is
definitely not a sustainable business model.

#### The challenges for employees

Holacracy requires a high degree of self-organization and personal responsibility from employees. But what if not
everyone is ready or capable of doing so? And what about the further development of employees? Often, they are the only
ones in their roles within the team and risk deviating from the optimal development path. Furthermore, employees are
usually not paid for their various roles, but for their main position, which can lead to a discrepancy between
responsibility and compensation.

### The Bureaucratic Monster

Ironically, holacracy, which aims for agility and flexibility, can lead to more bureaucracy. Because every team and
every employee must understand a wealth of rules and responsibilities. These new layers of bureaucracy can slow down the
company and counteract the actual purpose of holacracy. Holacracy even adds more meetings to everyday life.

### The Loss of Social Coherence

The flat hierarchies and the decentralized structure of holacracy can paradoxically lead to 'hidden hierarchies'. This
creates a social complexity that can contribute to misunderstandings and conflicts. There are no clear lines of
communication, which can promote a sense of isolation among teams and individuals.

### Conclusion

Holacracy is not a one-size-fits-all solution and definitely not suitable for every company, not for every team and not
for every employee. While the theoretical advantages sound attractive, numerous challenges and disadvantages arise in
practical application. Therefore, companies should carefully examine whether this organizational model fits their
culture, their goals and especially their employees. If the employees can already contribute, there is no need for
Holacracy. However, if the employees cannot contribute, Holacracy will also not be able to save anything.
