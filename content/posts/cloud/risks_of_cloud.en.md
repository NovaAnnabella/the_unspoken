# Risks of the Cloud - Why You Should Think Twice

### Introduction

The hype about the cloud is impossible to ignore. From small startups to large corporations - everyone is raving about
the flexibility, scalability, and simplicity of the cloud. But just like Icarus burned himself
when he flew too close to the sun, companies that move to the cloud without thinking could also experience dangerous pitfalls.

### Costs and Transparency

The cloud world may appear attractive, but high costs often hide behind the shiny facade. Companies that switch to the
cloud often notice too late how quickly the bills stack up. It is no coincidence that many companies that use AWS also
lay off staff or freeze salaries. The flexibility of the cloud is often offset by the unpredictability of costs. That
the cloud is very expensive should be clear and accepted.

#### Technology and Architecture

The extensive features of the cloud can seem like a dream, but they can also turn into a nightmare. The
lack of standard protocols means that your systems cannot easily, if at all, communicate with external or standard
technologies. In addition, infrastructure, architecture, and services often merge with each other,
which means that adjustments are required at both levels - a recipe for complexity and headaches.

### Security Risks and Transparency

While cloud providers offer extensive security mechanisms, the cloud remains an attractive target for 
cyber attacks. The question is not whether it is safer than an on-premise solution, but whether you want to take the risk 
of it. In addition, there is the problem of transparency: Without a clear view of usage and costs, meaningful 
budget planning is hardly possible. Due to many hidden costs, every cost planning should be multiplied 
by at least 2.

### Long-term Strategy and Human Resources

The choice for the cloud should not be made in isolation, but as part of a broader, long-term business strategy.
In addition, the choice of technology has a not to be underestimated influence on the type of
professionals you have to recruit for your company.

### Conclusion

The cloud is not the panacea it is often touted to be. It carries risks that should be seriously considered. From costs
to security, from technological restriction to personnel planning, the decision for the cloud is complex and should not
be taken lightly. It is worth considering alternatives like Kubernetes, which can offer flexibility, standardization,
and transparency.
