# Welcome to "The Unspoken"

**Decide for yourself what is true for you and what topics you prefer to ignore.**

I dare to explore the forbidden areas of development and uncover the extraordinary in the world of development.
Also expand your horizon and move your boundaries.
Always remember, technology should make our life and work easier.

**Only the bravest among us really succeed in making development easier for others.**

When was the last time you completed a project that was virtually maintenance-free, robust, and no longer required you? Never? Then you're doing something wrong!
